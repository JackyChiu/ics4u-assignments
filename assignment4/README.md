###Question 1: 
Create a class called Octal that deals with the number given in base 8.
  * a) Overload the arithmetic operators for the class (both binary and unary operators)
  * b) Overload the relational and equality operators for this class
  * c) Overload the stream insertion and stream extraction operator for the class

Try to use recursive functions when possible as part of you solution.

###Question 2.
Create a class called Combinatorics that given two positive integers n and r, such that n > r,
performs the following operations:
1. Finds the number of permutations (number of arrangements) of n elements taken r at a time
2. Prints out all possible arrangements 
3. Finds the number of combinations of n elements taken r at a time
4. Prints out all possible combinations
5. Prints the Pascalâ€™ triangle //optonal

Also,
  * a)	Overload the arithmetic operators for the class
(both binary and unary operators)
  * b)	Overload the relational and equality operators for this class
  * c)	 Overload the stream insertion and stream extraction operator for the class

###Question 3.
Take your class  Roman and 
  * a)	Overload the arithmetic operators for the class(both binary and unary operators)
  * b)	Overload the relational and equality operators for this class
  * c)	Overload the stream insertion and stream extraction operator for the class

###Question 4:
Take your class Aromatic and

  * a)	Overload the arithmetic operators for the class(both binary and unary operators)
  * b)	Overload the relational and equality operators for this class
  * c)	Overload the stream insertion and stream extraction operator for the class

###Question 5.
Write a class of your own choice. Overload some of the arithmetic, logical or relational operators, as well as the stream insertion (>>) and steam extraction operator for the variables of your own type.
