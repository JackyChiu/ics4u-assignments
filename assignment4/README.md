Question 3: Aromatic Numbers
An aromatic number is a number of the form ARARAR…AR, where each A is an Arabic digit, and each R is a Roman numeral. Each pair AR contributes a value described below, and by adding or subtracting these values together we get the value of the entire aromatic
number.
An Arabic digit A can be 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 or 9. A Roman numeral R is one of the seven letters (I to M) as described in Problem#1.
The value of pair AR is A times the base value of R. Normally, you add up the values of the pairs to get the overall value. However, wherever there are consecutive symbols ARA’R’ with R’ having a strictly bigger base value than R, the value of pair AR must be subtracted from the total, instead of being added.
For example, the number 3M1D2C has the value 3*1000 + 1*500 + 2*100 = 3700 and 3X2I4X has the value 3*10 – 2*1 + 4*10 = 68

Create a class called Aromatic for performing arithmetic on Roman numbers. Provide public member functions for each of the following:
a)	Overload the arithmetic operators for the class
(both binary and unary operators)

b)	Overload the relational and equality operators for this class

c)	 Overload the stream insertion and stream extraction operator for the class



Question 4.

Create a class called OctalNumbers taht is capable of performing arithmetic on Octal numbers:
d)	Overload the arithmetic operators for the class
(both binary and unary operators)

e)	Overload the relational and equality operators for this class

f)	 Overload the stream insertion and stream extraction operator for the class


Question 5.
Write a class of your own choice. Overload some of the arithmetic, logical or relational operators, as well as the stream insertion (>>) and steam extraction operator for the variables of your own type.
